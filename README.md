# Graph-Module
The graph module for the CompSci Project

Iteration 1: Creating an equation solver (solution button) for linear,quadratic and cubics
Iteration 2: Make all the GUIs 
Iteration 3: Creating an intersection solver for linear, quadratic and cubics
Iteration 4: Create a working graphing module with plotly or matplotlib
Work out what the next iterations will do
